# fintech-bootcamp-at-home

## Overview 

I wanted to attend [this bootcamp](https://www.edx.org/course/rice-university-fintech-boot-camp) but didn't want to spend $12K, since I'm at least familiar with 90% of the course topics already. This is my attempt to recreate [their curriculum](https://www.edx.org/course/rice-university-fintech-boot-camp#ed8d88d8-fc1e-53ec-a667-9d49433b683e) with cheap (and free) online resources.

After searching for a more detailed layout of the modules, I was lucky enough to find [this PDF](./Rice%20Fintech%20Bootcamp%20Curriculum%20Overview%202020-2021.pdf) on someone's LinkedIn profile; it doesn't directly provide what I wanted, but does include 6 sample projects with details on which skills they reinforce. 

Using this info as an anchor, I put together the following course plan (subject to change):

## Module 1: Intro to Fintech
- Fintech Landscape
- Financial Ratios
- Time-Series Analysis
- Project 1: [Risky Business](./project-1-risky-business.ipynb)

## Module 2: Financial Programming
- Python Data Libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Statistical Programming
- Project 2: Currency Predictor

## Module 3: Machine Learning (in Finance)
- Financial Modeling
- Machine Learning (Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Project 3: Trading Bot
- Forecasting
- Neural Networks (TensorFlow, Keras, RNN, etc.)
- Algorithmic Trading
- Project 4: Stock Predictor

## Module 4: Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
- Ethereum Ecosystem
- Project 5: Profit Splitter
- Project 6: [SPOILERS]

This is a work in progress, and meant to take 6 months to complete, so please bear with me while I build this out. 

If you have any feedback after August 2023, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/whitgroves/fintech-bootcamp-at-home/issues) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
