# fintech-bootcamp-at-home
I wanted to learn [this curriculum](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/fintech) but I'm too cheap for the price they were asking. Since I've dabbled with data science before and this has a heavy overlap with that, I'm attempting to recreate the essentials using (mostly) free resources, plus a little sleuthing and elbow grease.

The purpose of sharing this publicly is solely to "show my work". If you find this interesting, and you can afford it, you should consider taking their bootcamp at your local college.

# Module 1: Intro to Fintech
Admittedly this first section will have the most gaps in knowledge since there are a lot of "unknown unknowns" that only an expert would be able to provide context on. With that in mind, I intend to use this as a beginner's guide that can be used as a reference while I work through these projects.

It was also hasty to put Project 1 this early, but I figured jumping straight in would be the fastest way to identify knowledge gaps and know what to focus on moving forward.

## Project 1: [Risky Business](./project-1-risky-business.ipynb)
*In this exercise, you will assume the role of an analyst tasked with predicting credit risk using free data from peer-to-peer lending services.*

# Module 2: Financial Programming
This module is more of a technical gauntlet than anything else. There are plenty of free tutorials online, so running through each of those should be enough that I can at least know what to search for if I need to use them.
