# fintech-bootcamp-at-home
I wanted to attend [the edX fintech bootcamp](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/fintech) in February 2023, but the price was too damn high. While researching financing options, I found [their course overview](./Rice%20Fintech%20Bootcamp%20Curriculum%20Overview%202020-2021.pdf) on LinkedIn. From there I realized I had [some familiarity](https://github.com/whitgroves/data-science-intensive) with these topics, so I figured I could backfill the modules with online resources — similar to the [OSDSM](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go#the-open-source-data-science-masters) — and work through the sample projects to confirm my understanding.

To date, I've completed 5 projects using [these datasets](./data/README.md). Each notebook is written in [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [3.10 (Miniconda)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda-other-installer-links.html).

## Module 1: Intro to Fintech

### Project 1: [Risky Business](./project-1-risky-business.ipynb)
>*I placed this a bit early, but the idea was to close the module with a walkthrough of the programming side to identify which areas I needed to focus on for later sections. Content-wise, this should probably be after the Data Visualization sub-unit.*
