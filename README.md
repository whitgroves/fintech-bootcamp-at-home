# fintech-bootcamp-at-home
I wanted to learn [this curriculum](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/fintech) but I'm cheap. This is my attempt to recreate the essentials using (mostly) free resources, plus a little sleuthing and elbow grease.

Inspired by (but not affiliated with) [The Open Source Data Science Masters](https://github.com/datasciencemasters).
