# fintech-bootcamp-at-home
I wanted to attend [this bootcamp](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/fintech) but it was out of my price range. I still wanted to learn the material, so this is my attempt at a budget version for myself. 

I was fortunate enough to find [the bootcamp curriculum](./Rice%20Fintech%20Bootcamp%20Curriculum%20Overview%202020-2021.pdf) online, and based this study guide off of that. All resources listed are free unless otherwise indicated, and I am not affiliated with any of them.

At best this is a beginner's roadmap, and lacks the context that comes with experience. If you want to get industry-ready, consider taking the edX bootcamp at your local college.
