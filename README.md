# fintech-bootcamp-at-home
I wanted to attend a fintech bootcamp but it was out of my price range. This is my budget version using [a copy of their curriculum](./Rice%20Fintech%20Bootcamp%20Curriculum%20Overview%202020-2021.pdf) I found online.

Unless otherwise indicated, all notebooks are written in [Python 3.11.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/), using a virtual environment with [these packages](./requirements.txt).

Most of these resources are free, and I am not affiliated with any of them or edX. If you want to get industry-ready, consider taking [their bootcamp](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/fintech) at your local college.
