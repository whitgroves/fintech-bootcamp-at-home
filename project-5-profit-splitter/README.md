# fintech-bootcamp-at-home/project-5-profit-splitter
Unlike projects 1-4, this project is Solidity-based, and thus doesn't have a notebook. Instead, this folder contains the smart contract written for the project and this README with the project prompt and implementation notes.

## Prompt
*"Your new start-up has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, but now the team wants to use it to help automate some of the company finances. The goal is to make things easier internally, increase transparency, and make accounting and auditing practically automatic. You will develop smart contracts with Solidity to pay employees, distribute profits to different tiers of employees, and distribute company shares for those employees in the equity incentive plan."*

## Approach
- Make basic contract to auto-split ETH received via `recieve()` and the [withdrawal pattern](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-from-contracts) - (Done)
- Setup payment tiers
- Setup equity incentive plan

## Results
TBD
